## SQL Support Library

These facilities provide a low-level framework which would be useful for many projects.

You might want to study these files in dependency order.

These files will get you started:

| Special File		| Description
|-----------------------|------------
| settings.sql		| included by all but brama.sql
| ../settings.sql	| included by settings.sql AND brama.sql
| brama.sql		| prepares an empty Wicci database
| WICCI-SQL-FILES	| lists files in dependency order
